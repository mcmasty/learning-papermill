Clone repository then use either `make` or `pip`

From the `learning-papermill` directory use command

### Sanity check  

This example application also uses the [Click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.1.x/) framework for the 
Command-Line-Interface.  

The cli app has the name `paper`  

Issuing `paper` command will expose all the current available actions in the app.  


`paper hello` will echo `hello` is useful for sanity checks.
